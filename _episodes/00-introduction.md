## What is FAIR?

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
The FAIR principles are originated in data management and
have served as a flagship for promoting good data management practices.
However, only recently, the principles have been applied to software.

In general, central to the realization of FAIR​ are FAIR Digital Objects,
which may represent​ data, **software** or other research resources.
